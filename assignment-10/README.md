1) The universal element is used to select everything on the page. This could be
used to set the font, or other very broad styling options that will apply to
everything. Element selector types are used to select a specific tag. For example
if one wanted all paragraphs in a page to look the same, they would style the
<p> tag in their stylesheet. Class selector types are simply classes that you
make and then can apply to anything you want. These are good for things that
you will use often throughout the whole page, and needs to be applied to multiple
things. And finally the ID selector type is what someone would use to style a
specific group of things with that ID. If you want to style the intro paragraph
separately from the others, then you will need to give them an ID and then style
that in your stylesheet.
2) The three colors I chose were #D20077, #6F6A6D, and #E7E7E7. I chose these
colors because they all compliment each other nicely, with the greys and whites
acting as a base, and then using the pink to make things stand out.
3)  This week I really struggled with aligning pictures and other things. If
I tried to align things side by side they seemed to sit on top of each other
or overlap no matter what I tried. I overcame this by changing the layout of my
page, and instead of having the pictures side by side I put them vertical from
each other. In the future, I would definitely like to learn more about aligning
things in many different ways so I can be more creative with my page layout.
