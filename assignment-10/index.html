    <h1>Popular 1980s Consoles</h1>

    <br />

    <div id="intro" class="main-text">
      <br />
        <p>A lot was happening in the 1980's. People were starting to branch out <br />
          and accept more things, fashion was changing drastically, and technology <br />
          was growing faster than ever. However perhaps the most exciting thing was the <br />
          boom of video games. Arcades were busy, making millions, and eventually <br />
          the first home console came out. Below are some of the most popular home <br />
          consoles that revolutionized gaming. </p>

      <p> Above is the first NES system to come out internationally. It featured <br />
          games like Mario, Zelda, and more that made the game console incredibly <br />
          popular for all age groups, which was a big selling point for Nintendo. <br /></p>

      <p> And here we have an Atari 7800. This model was the next gen of it's previous <br />
          versions (the 2600 and 5200), and is special because it was technically <br />
          the first console to have backwards combatibility for it's games.</p>
