# Solomon Albertson-Gores' MART341-WebDesign
Repository for my Introduction to Web Design &amp; Development Homework

Week 2) This week students learned about files and directories, and the relationship they have with eachother. During this we covered all of the different potential file types including the best ones for website design. Students also learned about VCS and the benefits it has to offer. Finally we created a new folder for this week and did a short assignment discussing the internet, worldwide web, VCS benefits, and some personal interests. I expierenced no challenges during this week/assignment.
