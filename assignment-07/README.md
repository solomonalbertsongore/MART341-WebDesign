1) I've seen many forms over the web. Of course the majority are information collectors for your email,
passwords, and so on. A lot of them also are surveys. However one I just thought of would be live chat feeds,
meant to connect people online like texting. I'm not sure how it works exactly but it is a type of form I suppose.
Even search bars count, so probably every modern website has at least some form of form/input.

2) A text input would be used for someone to enter in their email in order to log into something, subscribe, etc.
A selection input would be used for online quizzes, surveys, perhaps even for ordering online (selection options). A button input usually is
for a password submit, but could also be used to open up other pages, start or end something, etc.  

3)Similar to last assignment I just followed the list of items needed on the page as I went. I saved super often (every time I made a change)
and always checked to make sure things still worked afterword's. I also had to reference W3 Schools and the class module quite often
to ensure I was using the correct tags. I think this took me around an hour to an hour and a half in total.
