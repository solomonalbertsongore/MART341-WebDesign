    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Slice of salmon</li>
        <li>1 cup of brown rice</li>
        <li>Brussel sprouts</li>
        <li>Green pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Sprinkle of <dfn title="similar to table salt but has healthier properties">himalayn sea salt</dfn></li>
        <li>Sprinkle of tumeric</li>
        <li>Sprinkle of roasted garlic and herbs seasoning</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Start by cooking the rice in either a rice cooker or pot on the stove.
          This will probably take around <strong>20 minutes.</strong></li>
        <li>After the rice is started pull out the salmon and wash off the front
          and back with cool water. Place in a paper towel and damp off
          both sides. After that is done, combine all of the spices
          and sauces (everything after "green pepper") into a bowl <br/><strong><em>(mix exteremely well)</em></strong> and place salmon inside. Let it sit or marinate
          for ideally <b>20 minutes</b> (10 is fine too). Mix marinade up onto salmon every so often,
          and be sure to let it sit on <em>both sides</em>.</li>
        <li>After salmon has sat in the marinade for a while cook it on a heated cast iron
          pan with medium heat and extra virgin olive oil for 5 minutes each side.
        <li>While the salmon is cooking cook the brussel sprouts and pepper in a
          seperate pan. Season with salt, and cook with extra virgin olive oil on
          medium heat.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
