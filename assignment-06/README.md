1) You can in some situations but it is standard to have **only one** ```<head>``` and ```<body>``` element in an html page. The ```<head>``` is used to
establish things like the pages language, author, screen sizing, and so on. The ```<body>``` element
contains everything that the page user will see and interact with (all of the content).
2) Structural markup essentially manages the information on a page through paragraphs, headings, lists, and so on. Semantic markup literally changes the meaning of content on the website
For example if you italicize a word, some webpages might not recognize it therefore won't show it. But if you *emphasize* it all web browsers will understand to italicize the word or words.
3) I just started top to bottom, filling in things as I went and occasionally referencing Module 6 for tags I needed. It was quite straightforward.
