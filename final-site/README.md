1) I didn't learn a ton more about web development overall, since I already knew some basics.
However I did learn how data transfer/servers work however which was cool.
I'm glad we went through it however as I got a great refresher and am much more comfortable with it now.

2)  I learned **SO** much about web design it's hard to say it all. Some big highlights
for me was embedding and typography. They are both super useful tools. However just
getting more comfortable with CSS was the biggest thing, and I'm so grateful for it.
Learning things like div structures and how to style them improved my capabilities so
much. 

3) The only challenge I had with this assignment was a white space that kept appearing
at the bottom of each page. If the page didn't contain enough content to fill the whole
page there was this box of white that would always appear at the bottom. I read tons
of forums and couldn't figure out what was causing it, so I'm assuming it was the CSS
Framework I was using, Bulma. After researching for a long time and finding no solution
I decided to just fill the white space using ```<br>``` tags. I'm not sure this was
the proper was to handle it, but it was the solution I came up with.
