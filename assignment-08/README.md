1) Div tags are used to block content together on a website. They can be used to separate content and section
them out. Spans are inline changes to content using the style tag and forms of CSS. If you wanted a whole paragraph stylized, you would use a div tag. If you wanted just a single sentence out of a paragraph stylized, you'd use a span tag. Id tags are unique to anything they are on and are used to identify elements, and only one 
element can have a specific id. For example, if you are collecting data from a user, an id tag would be used to identify the input box they used and what they typed in. Classes however can be used on as many things as you'd like, which makes them great for things like styling.
2) The advantage of using a service like Youtube for videos is that it's cheap, easy to do, and loads fast. The disadvantage
is that Youtube could take down the content, the link could expire, or it could just disappear.
3) The biggest challenge I had this week was finding out how to embed media. I overcame this by going over the code, rereading instructions and some things on the module.
Turns out that I jumped a couple of steps and tried to do something more complicated than actually necessary to make the media appear.
