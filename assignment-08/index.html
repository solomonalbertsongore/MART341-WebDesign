        [Intro] <br />
        Drama <br />
        Yeah <br />

        [Verse 1] <br />
        Yeah, I been runnin' and runnin' <br />
        To keep it a hundred, this is all that I wanted <br />
        But lately I don't got the stomach <br />
        The higher the summit the harder the plummet <br />
        They know me all over this planet <br />
        I'm just a man and I can't understand it <br />
        Proud that I'm winning, I did it myself <br />
        Probably wouldn't if I got the help <br />
        Hearing subliminals all in cell <br />
        Feel like I'm breaking, I'm fallin' to hell <br />
        Told me I'm sick and I tell her "Oh, well" <br />
        Rather be dead than to know that I failed <br />
        Live for the chase, life is a race <br />
        I'm outa space homie get out my face <br />
        I got a taste, want the whole plate <br />
        Finna get laced if you're stepping out place like <br />

        <br />

        [Chorus] <br />
        First off, you don't run nothing <br />
        All talk and you're team bluffing <br />
        My squad, we all dream crushing <br />
        We ain't rushin', no discussion <br />
        All I know is I was made for this <br />
        Paid for this, yeah, I slaved for this <br />
        Been down and Imma get it right <br />
        Dead on sight like <br />
        Run for your life <br />

        <br />

        [Drop] <br />
        Run for your life <br />
        Been down and Imma get it right <br />
        Dead on sight like <br />
        Run for your life <br />
        Run for your life <br />
        Been down and Imma get it right <br />
        Dead on sight like <br />

        <br />

        [Post-Drop] <br />
        (Run for your life) <br />

        [Verse 2] <br />
        Never really know, when you gonna go <br />
        Why you gotta put another foot in front of y'all's <br />
        Bury them toes, carry them close <br />
        I was never one to care about momentous <br />
        I was like froze, now I'm on fire <br />
        Give me that smoke, but I can't get higher <br />
        We do the most here to inspire <br />
        Doing what I'm supposed, but I can't get tired <br />
        Run for your life every night <br />
        See in the dark, blind by the light <br />
        I got the spark, I got the pipes <br />
        All of my art's coming to life <br />
        Had to face my fears while I chase my peers <br />
        Then I found my spot <br />
        'Bout time that I found myself <br />
        I been out here walking that walk like <br />

        <br />

        [Chorus] <br />
        First off, you don't run nothing <br />
        All talk and you're team bluffing <br />
        My squad, we all dream crushing <br />
        We ain't rushin', no discussion <br />
        All I know is I was made for this <br />
        Paid for this, yeah, I slaved for this <br />
        Been down and Imma get it right <br />
        Dead on sight like <br />
        Run for your life <br />
        First off, you don't run nothing <br />
        All talk and you're team bluffing <br />
        My squad, we all dream crushing <br />
        We ain't rushin', no discussion <br />
        All I know is I was made for this <br />
        Paid for this, yeah, I slaved for this <br />
        Been down and Imma get it right <br />
        Dead on sight like <br />
        Run for your life <br />

        <br />

        [Drop] <br />
        Run for your life <br />
        Been down and Imma get it right <br />
        Dead on sight like <br />
        Run for your life <br />
        Run for your life <br />
        Been down and Imma get it right <br />
