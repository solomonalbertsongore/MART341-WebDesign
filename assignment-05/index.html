    <h1>The Lord of the Rings</h1>
    <h2>J.R.R. Tolkein</h2>

    <hr />

    <p>A group of heroes known as The Fellowship of the Ring sets out in order<br />
       to destroy an all powerful ring in order to stop perhaps the most<br />
       dangerous being in Middle Earth, Sauron. This world has many races<br />
       such as elfs, dwarves, and hobbits, while also featuring normal humans.<br />
       As the brave group travels across Middle Earth they participate in large<br />
       battles, of both monsters and men, and much more.</p>
