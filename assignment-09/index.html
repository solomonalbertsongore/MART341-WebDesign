    <div id="discord-intro" class="general-writing">
      <p>Hello there, virtual friend. It appears that by some fate of destiny <br />
        you have been brought to the wonderful land of gaming, or perhaps are <br />
        just in need of a communication system for a wonderful group of friends. <br />
        Well have no fear! <span class="linkcolor"><a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank"><b>Discord</b></a></span> can offer such services. Simply <br />
        follow the steps below to create a wonderful group chat/gathering for you <br />
        and your friends. Let us begin below! To start, please begin by either downloading <br />
        the Discord app or opening it up on your browser (either will work).
      </p>
    </div>

    <hr />

    <div id="materials-section" class="general-writing">
      <h2>Materials</h2>
        <p>To begin, you will need the following:
          <li>A functioning computer</li>
          <li>WiFi/stable internet connection</li>
          <li>A web browser (such as Google)</li>
        </p>
    </div>

    <hr />

    <div id="step-one" class="general-writing">
      <h2>Step 1</h2>
        <p>Now that you are all settled at your computer and ready to work, it is time <br />
          to begin! Start by either <b>downloading</b> discord or opening up discord up <br />
          in a seperate web browser (which can be done by clicking the link above).
          <img src="./images/discord-website-part1.png" alt="Discord website" width="750"> <br />
          <br />
          Once this is open, you are going to click the "Plus" button below to create a new <br />
          server. It should look something like this: <br />
          <br />
          <img src="./images/discordscreenshot-p2.png" alt="Plus button in discord(on the left side)" width="" height=""> <br />
          <br />
          Ahah! Progress! Now we will be greeted with a prompt offering us several templates to <br />
          choose from. However, in our case we will be creating a custome one, so select "Create My Own!" <br />
          <br />
          <img src="./images/create-a-server.png" alt="Server creation prompt" width="350"> <br />
          <br />
          It will also give you the option to either create one for you and your friends, <br />
          or for a club or community. Choose whichever one you need for you discord purposes! <br />
          Finally, you will be asked to create a name and add a photo. Keep in mind this <em>can</em> be <br />
          changed later if you wish. And that conludes step one! <br />
          Next we will look at our server, and all of the different things <br />
          we can add to it!
        </p>
    </div>

    <hr style="width: 30%;" />

    <div id="step-two" class="general-writing">
      <h2>Step 2</h2>
        <p>I'm glad to see you have made it this far! This is where it starts to get fun, so congrats! <br />
          Assuming you are starting from where we left off from last section, you should be looking at <br />
          something similar to what I have below: <br />
          <br />
          <img src="./images/starting-server-screen.png" alt="Starting Server Screen" width="900"> <br />
          <br />
          I have taken point of several things in this screen. As you will see there is a <strong>text</strong> channel <br />
          and <strong>voice</strong> channel. These are pretty self explanitory, as the text channel you can type in, <br />
          and the voice channel you can hop in and speak to people using a microphone connected to your PC or Mac. <br />
          By clikcing the plus signs above either group of channels you can add a new one, as well as many as you'd like! <br />
          Finally, you can also make categories, simiar to folders, for channels. This is done by <em>right clicking anywhere <br />
          in the channel screen, and selecting "Create Category"</em>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <hr style="width: 30%;"/>

    <div id="step-three" class="general-writing">
      <h2>Step 3</h3>
        <p>The final step is quite simple! Customize your discord server, and have fun! <br />
          I will be doing this by adding some emojies, channels, and changing the name of the server. <br />
          Below is a video of how these things can be achieved, and some tools. <br />
