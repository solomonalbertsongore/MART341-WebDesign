  1) Overall my HTML learning expierence was really good. I don't usually do super well with code but since this is so simple it's easy for me to grasp
and I really like that about it. The only thing I really have trouble with is remembering all of the tags and elements. There really is so much so I 
have to constantly look up stuff to get what I need every time. 
  2) I'm really excited to learn all of CSS. A cool website is really satisfying to interact with and just be on, and I would love to learn how to do that myself. 
  I think in particular I'm really excited to learn how to create a nice navigation UI and cool backgrounds for my websites. I think those things really make 
  a website come together. 
  3) My challenges mostly were trying to incorporate those "Discord" images on the left and right sides of the websites. The rest of the content did not want to cooperate 
  with it so I had to settle of a not as good version to get it too settle. However I also think it was creative and kind of worked so it was also a success! In order to 
  overcome this I just played around with the arrangement of my code until I got something acceptable, and I also looked up some tags.
