1) A **system font** is a font that was already pre-installed or installed by you
on to the system. They are only available to you. A **web font** are fonts that
are on a websites server (the web dev uploads them). And **web-safe fonts** are
fonts that are on every system, and should even be interchangeable between operating
software's.

2) It is really important to have fallback fonts incase one of your fonts becomes
unavailable. This is really important while making styling choices, because if
you design a whole page off of one font, and that font does not appear, the system
will choose some of the most basic ones (a web-safe font) and your whole style
could be ruined. So you should always have at least one back-up!

3) I had a lot of challenges. Things like padding, and many other minute details
were very present for me this project. However they were quick and simple to fix.
Perhaps the greatest challenge I had was properly downloading/applying a font.
For some reason my fonts.css page would not link to my index.html. In the end
I had to delete all of the fonts and link tags, and just restart. That ended up
working. There was probably one small thing wrong with it, but I was unable to
find it, so I just restarted!
