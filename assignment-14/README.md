1) I chose to use Bulma's CSS Framework library.

2) I used a CDN, because it makes for a faster website and is easier to implement, and I don't have to host it myself.

3) HTML5 opens a whole new door to web development. It allows developers to have much
more flexibility with their work, giving them way more customizability with the websites
they develop.

4) My challenges this week were once again optimizing for mobile, and also getting JavaScript
to actually draw something on the canvas. No matter what I tried, even when using others code,
it wouldn't show up. I overcame the mobile optimization by constantly resizing my window to
see if it worked as I went. With JavaScript, I looked up information and solutions for a quite a long time, reading as many forums as I could. Eventually I came across an answer for another similar problem a developer had and solved it. In the end it was because my canvas was after my ```<script>``` tag containing the JavaScript file. Made me laugh considering all the hours I put into it. Anyways, it was a good week! I really enjoyed Bulma and hope to become very familiar with it in the future.
