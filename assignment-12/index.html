    <p class="generaltext" id="paragraph1">In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, <br />
       wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor <br />
       yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on <br />
       or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

       <br />
       <br />

       It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a <br />
       shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to <br />
       a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without <br />
       smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided <br />
       with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats - the <br />
       hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly <br />
       but not quite straight into the side of the hill - The Hill, as all the <br />
       people for many miles round called it - and many little round doors <br />
       opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going <br />
       upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries <br />
       (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens,<br />
       dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage.<br/>
       The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for <br />
       these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows <br />
       looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.

       This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. <br />
       The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out <br />
       of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not only because <br />
       most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures <br />
       or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say <br />
       on any question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of <br />
       how a Baggins had an adventure, found himself doing and saying things <br />
       altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours' respect, but <br />
       he gained-well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.
