1) Borders are simply a stylized box put around text, images, or anything
you'd like to separate it from other content on the page. Padding is the space
between the contents in a border and the border itself. Margin is the space
between the border and all of the other content on the page. It is the true
separator of content in a page.

2) Unfortunately this week I fell ill, so the main challenge for me was
simply finding the energy and proper thought process to do the homework. It
was very hard for me to focus and absorb content but I just forced myself to
do it.
