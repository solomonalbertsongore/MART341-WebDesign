1) My imaginary client was a photographer. The site wanted was a simple site mostly used as an online portfolio to showcase their work, while also providing a way for people to get in contact with them, book photoshoots, and find their socials.

2) I've learned from this site it is imperative to design for mobile first because that is the primary platform people use. Most people will go to their phone before a computer to look up information. Not only that, but it is much harder to go back after already designing a site to make it mobile friendly. If you design with the idea of mobile first, you can add to it later to make it more appropriate for computers.

3) My primary challenge was trying to optimize my site for mobile. I originally designed it for computers with large screens, so trying to shrink everything afterwards became quite the struggle. I overcame them by doing research and asking my professor some questions. It's definitely not perfect however, and I need much more practice in order to learn how to properly do it in the future. In the end, I couldn't get my navbar to operate properly on my phone, or a hamburger menu to work, but shrinking it in the window worked fine. I'd like to learn how to create a hamburger menu in the future so I can have a cleaner mobile version.
